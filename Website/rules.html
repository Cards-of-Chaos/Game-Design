    Cards of Chaos utilizes the Game Master and Player structure. Your Game Master, or Chaos Master (CM), is the governing body of the game at your table. They are responsible for running the game. The Players are what make the game come to life with interesting characters and a passion for story. The players and the CM work together in tandem to tell compelling stories. 
    Cards of Chaos was created out of a joint passion of the designers for deck builder card games and table top role playing games. We hope that traditional TTRPG players and deck builders find Cards of Chaos the perfect blend of these game types. As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring.

### The Game

Cards of Chaos was created out of a joint passion of the designers for deck builder card games and table top role playing games. We hope that traditional TTRPG players and deck builders find Cards of Chaos the perfect blend of these game types. As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring. 

### Building your Deck

When you build your first deck in Cards of Chaos, you'll first have to decide what type of character you want to be. Are you interested in playing an explosive Berserker, smashing those who stand in your way? Maybe you'd rather rely on stealth and cunning, waiting for the perfect moment to strike true and deliver one deadly blow. Whatever style of play you choose, this will be the backdrop for your personalized deck. 

As your character grows and develops, they will naturally gain more power and harness more Chaos Energy, allowing for more explosive, dynamic, and interesting spells. The following table describes at what level your character will gain access to more cards and more Chaos Energy.

### Combat

Chaos is the name of the game, and what's Chaos without Combat? At the beginning of combat, each combatant will roll their D20 and add their Chaos Attribute Modifier. The combatant with the highest number goes first, and so on. 
After turn order is determined, each player will take their respective turn.

#### Taking a Turn

On each of your turns, you will start with your maximum amount of Chaos Energy at your disposal. At the start of your turn, you will draw one card. Then, you may do the following in any order. 
- Move
- Act
	- Cast Action
	- Kinesthetic Action
			- Dash
			- Hide
			- Weapon Attack
			- Dodge
			- Use Object
			- Climb
			- Grapple
			- Tackle
			- Talk
- Use an Ability 
- Free Action

**Move**
On each of your turns, you may move up to your listed movement speed. This movement does not need to happen all at once. For example, a player may move 3 spaces to get within melee range of an enemy, and then move an additional 3 spaces away from that enemy. Your movement may be increased or decreased depending on the situation, so be sure to keep note of any spells or conditions affecting you during a game. 

**Act**

	Choosing to act during a climactic scene where time is of the essence can be stressful. You'll have multiple choices to make with cards you may or may not have been expecting to draw, allies in need, enemies attacking, another player giving you additional information, and maybe you need to go to the bathroom. The last thing you or your table need is someone barking orders at you or making you feel rushed. 
	When players are just beginning to learn the ins and outs of the game, they won't be familiar with their characters or their decks. Be patient with players when they are first starting, and offer help when asked. And if you are a new player learning everything all at once, just remember there are no wrong choices. Follow your gut and do what's fun. 

*Cast Action (s)*
The leading form of harnessing Chaos Energy, spellcasting. Casting spells will most often be what you spend your turns doing in a game of Cards of Chaos. During your turn, you will have the ability to cast any number of spells in your hand with your alloted Chaos Energy unless otherwise specified. Spells may be cast in or outside of combat, and some will have varying effects based on the situation they are cast in. Other spells contain tags to indicate additional effects or stipulations. Read your spell cards closely to avoid misplays and maximize value! 

*Kinesthetic Actions*
You may choose to take a Kinesthetic Action instead of a Cast Action. These actions are fully dependent on your character's attributes. Your CM may require a Power Check for the Hide, Melee, Use Object, Climb, Grapple, and Tackle, Actions, or a Personality Check for the Talk Action. 
	- Dash: Double Movement
	- Hide: Hide from being detected. Enemies may roll against you. 
	- Weapon Attack: Attack from specified weapon range. Weapon Attack deals damage equal to Power Modifier * 3, unless otherwise specified by the weapon. A punch would deal damage equal to Power Modifier unless otherwise specified. 
	- Dodge: Until your next turn, reduce the amount of damage taken by spell attacks and effects by Power Modifier * 3, and gain advantage on Saves, unless otherwise specified. 
	- Use Object: Work with your CM to determine if the object you are trying to use would take a longer amount of time than 1 round, and what check (if any) is needed. 
	- Climb: 
	- Grapple: 
	- Tackle: 
	- Talk: The talk action will normally require a Personality Check. Typically it is used to deescalate a situation, distract, or gain information. 

**Responses**
At the end of your turn, if you have any unused Chaos Energy, it will remain until the beginning of your next turn. Some spells have the "Response" tag. These spells may only be cast in response to a trigger. These triggers may be specific and described on the spell card, or more general to be worked out between you and your Chaos Master. 
Responses follow the last in, first out rule. This means the last card played will be the first effect that happens in a series. For example: 
	An enemy attacks you for 10 fire damage. You respond by casting Elemental Resistance. The Elemental Resistance spell happens first, followed by the attack. You would take 5 fire damage. 
	An enemy Chaos Caster attacks you with a fireball. You respond with Counterspell to stop the effect. The enemy casts their own Counterspell in response. Your Counterspell against the Fireball is nullified, and the Fireball goes off. 

These effects can become overwhelming with multiple responses being used simultaneously in the heat of combat. Be patient with yourself, your fellow players, and your Chaos Master when working through all of the effects and their respective position in order.

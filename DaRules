### The Game

Cards of Chaos utilizes the Game Master and Player structure. Your Game Master, or Chaos Master (CM), is the governing body of the game at your table. They are responsible for running the game. The Players are what make the game come to life with interesting characters and a passion for story. The players and the CM work together in tandem to tell compelling stories. 
Cards of Chaos was created out of a joint passion of the designers for deck builder card games and table top role playing games. We hope that traditional TTRPG players and deck builders find Cards of Chaos the perfect blend of these game types. As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring. 

### Creating Your Character

The first step in character creation is developing a background for your character to fit them into the game world they'll be inhabiting. Choose a race or species (such as Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Orc, Animal Folk etc.) for your character that fits in the world your CM has created. Your choice will not have a mechanic impact on the game, but may help you determine how the character is played or interacts with the world. Your background can include the profession of your character and/or reasoning for seeking adventure. Use your character background information to guide your choices when developing your character. 

Characters beginning their journey at level 1 will generally be unskilled with little adventuring experience. Keep this in mind when creating your early level characters and speak with your CM if there are certain experiences you feel your character should possess. Overall, have fun and be creative when making your background. This is your opportunity to create a character that matches your playstyle and will shape how your character interacts with the world created by your CM.

When creating your character, there will be three distinct factors to guide your decision making process: The Class, Attributes, and Features.  

#### Features

Character features will help the player differentiate their character from the other player characters. Since picking a race in this game does not grant any mechanical advantages, the player can instead choose which features their character has from the start. Players receive 5 Character Points at the beginning of character creation used to buy Features from the Character Feature Page. Players can choose any combination of features, but the total Character Points of these features cannot exceed 5, and no Feature can be purchased twice. Character Features grant you the opportunity to make a character unique. Choose a combination that feels powerful or a combination that is thematic with your background. For example, a background of a scholarly elf could lead to a player choosing darkvision and a skill proficiency in knowledge. Keep in mind, once character features are solidified with the CM they cannot be changed unless specified by the CM.

#### Attributes

In Cards of Chaos, characters have four main Attributes that define their skills and abilities. Each Attribute starts with 5 points, equal to a modifier of 0. Each point over 5 is plus 1 to the Attribute's modifier. Each point under 5 is minus 1 to the Attribute's modifier. The maximum amount of points for an Attribute is 10 (a +5 modifier), with a minimum of 0 (a -5 modifier). At Levels 4, 8, 12, and 15 you will gain an additional two Attribute Points to distribute among the four possible Attributes. At level 1, you get 2 ability points to put into any of the four Attributes. If you choose, you can also reduce one Attribute from the base 5 to 4 at level 1, and gain an additional Attribute Point to distribute to a thrid Attribute. No single Attribute can be at a score of 8 at level 1. The four Attributes are: 

##### Chaos 
Your Chaos Attribute relates to how much control you have over Chaos Magic. You will use your Chaos Modifier for checks and saves relating to magic. When attempting to resist a magical effect, you will likely add your chaos modifier to your saving throw. 
Your Spell Save DC is equal to 8 + Chaos Modifier + Proficiency.  

##### Power
Your Power Attribute relates to how much control you have over your physical form. You will use your Power Modifier for checks and saves relating to the kinesthetic. This includes Weapon Attacks, grappling, and others. 

##### Prowess

Your Prowess Attribute relates to how much control you have over social encounters. You will use your Prowess Modifier for social checks and saves.

##### Tenacity
Your Tenacity Attribute will inform your total amount of Hit Points (HP) available to you. Your base amount of HP will be determined by your class, with HP being added or subtracted by your Health Modifier. The Tenacity Attribute will also be used for medicine, exhaustion, and overall vitality checks and saves. 

#### Class
Picking the Character Class when developing your character will determine what spells, abilities, and bonuses you have at your disposal. Each class has a distinct set of abilities, however, some spells are not exclusive to one class. Look over each option when determining your Character's Class:

*Active Ability:* For 2 Ability Points, the next spell you cast that deals damage heals a separate target for half the damage dealt. 

### Building your Deck

Building a deck is the most important aspect of this game. It allows you to create a unique combination of spells that will allow your character to excel in combat and navigate the world around you. You are never locked into a set deck as you will have the ability to exchange cards in your deck with other spells from your spell list during a short and long rest. The diagram below indicates how many of each spell level you can have in your deck, how many of each card of a specific spell level, and your deck size as you level up on your adventure.

After you build your deck, you may build a sideboard to exchange cards in your deck during short rests. Your sideboard can include any spellcard your character has access to casting. You may be prepared for a fight against a large beast in the forest that's been terrorizing a small village, when you get sidetracked by an immminent threat to your home city. Your sideboard should consist of cards that you feel may be useful to you at some point during the course of a day in your game, but not for your current objective. Think of your sideboard as your emergency kit. You hope you won't need it, but it's a good thing to have. See rules on Rests to read more rules about your Sideboard. 

### Combat

Chaos is the name of the game, and what's Chaos without Combat? At the beginning of combat, each combatant will draw their initial hand of cards for the combat from the top of their deck. The amount of initial cards drawn will change over time, and can be found in the Deck Building Table above. After drawing their cards, each fighter roll a D20 and add their Power Modifier. The combatant with the highest number goes first, and so on. Once each character in the initiataive order has finished their turn, it resets to the top of the order. That is one round. Each round takes 6 seconds of in game time. 

#### Taking a Turn

On each of your turns, you will start with your maximum amount of Chaos Energy at your disposal. At the start of your turn, you will draw one card. Then, you may do the following in any order. 
- Move
- Cast Action
- Kinesthetic Action
	- Dash
	- Hide
	- Weapon Attack
	- Dodge
	- Use Object
	- Climb
	- Grapple
	- Tackle
	- Talk
- Ability Action
- Free Action

###### Movement

On each of your turns, you may move up to your listed movement speed. This movement does not need to happen all at once. For example, a player may move 3 spaces to get within melee range of an enemy, and then move an additional 3 spaces away from that enemy. Your movement may be increased or decreased depending on the situation, so be sure to keep note of any spells or conditions effecting you during a game. 

**Moving Through Occupied Spaces**

When moving through a space currently occupied by an ally, you may move through their space freely, as long as they are not attempting to block your movement. When attempting to move through an enemy space, the enemy may attempt a Kinesthetic action such as grapple or a weapon attack if they have the required Chaos Energy. No spells outside of response spells may be cast as part of this action. 

##### Act

Choosing to act during a climactic scene where time is of the essence can be stressful. You'll have multiple choices to make with cards you may or may not have been expecting to draw, allies in need, enemies attacking, another player giving you additional information, and maybe you need to go to the bathroom. The last thing you or your table need is someone barking orders at you or making you feel rushed. 
When players are just beginning to learn the ins and outs of the game, they won't be familiar with their characters or their decks. Be patient with players when they are first starting, and offer help when asked. If you are a new player learning everything all at once, just remember there are no wrong choices. Follow your gut and do what's fun. 

###### Cast Action

The leading form of harnessing Chaos Energy, spellcasting. Casting spells will most often be what you spend your turns doing in a game of Cards of Chaos. During your turn, you will have the ability to cast any number of spells in your hand with your alloted Chaos Energy unless otherwise specified. Spells may be cast in or outside of combat, and some will have varying effects based on the situation they are cast in. Other spells contain tags to indicate additional effects or stipulations. Read your spell cards closely to avoid misplays and maximize value.

###### Kinesthetic Actions

You may choose to take one Kinesthetic Action before or after your Cast Action. Your CM may require a Power Check for the Hide, Melee, Use Object, Climb, Grapple, and Tackle Actions, or a Prowess Check for the Talk Action. 
	- Dash: For one Chaos Energy, double your movement. 
	- Hide: For two Chaos Energy, you may attempt to hide from detection. An enemy may attempt to find you with a Power Check against your Power Save DC. 
	- Weapon Attack: For one Chaos Energy, attack from a specified weapon range. Weapon Attack deals damage equal to Power Modifier * 3, unless otherwise specified by the weapon. An unarmed attack deals damage equal to your Power Modifier unless otherwise specified. 
	- Dodge: For three Chaos Energy, until your next turn, reduce the amount of damage taken by spell attacks and effects by Power Modifier * 3, and gain advantage on all Saves, unless otherwise specified. 
	- Use Object: Work with your CM to determine if the object you are trying to use would take a longer amount of time than 1 round, and what check (if any) is needed. 
	- Climb: For one Chaos Energy, your climbing speed is equal to half your walking speed, unless you have the *Climber* Feature. Your CM may call for a Power Check. 
	- Grapple: For two mana, you may attempt to grapple another creature. The target makes a Power Save against your Power Save DC. On a failure, you have the opposing creature grappled. 
	- Tackle: For one Chaos Energy, you may attempt to tackle another creature. The target must make a Power Save against your power save DC. On a failure, the opposing creature is knocked prone. 
	- Talk: The talk action will normally require a Prowess Check against the target's Save DC. Typically it is used to deescalate a situation, distract, or gain information during combat. 

##### Ability Action
Abilities are specified by character class during the character creation process. The Ability Point cost associated with each class' specific abilities are described during the character creation process. Your number of ability points are equal to Proficiency Bonus plus Power Modifier. 

##### Free Action
A Free Action consists of any small action that likely will not have any associated checks. Some examples may include a shout or a wave. Work with your CM to determine what a Free Action might consist of for your table. 

##### Responses
At the end of your turn, if you have any unused Chaos Energy, it will remain until the beginning of your next turn. Some spells have the "Response" tag. These spells may only be cast in response to a trigger. These triggers may be specific and described on the spell card, or more general to be worked out between you and your Chaos Master. 
Responses follow the last in, first out rule. This means the last card played will be the first effect that happens in a series. For example: 
	An enemy attacks you for 10 fire damage. You respond by casting Elemental Resistance. The Elemental Resistance spell happens first, followed by the attack. You would take 5 fire damage. 
	An enemy Chaos Caster attacks you with a fireball. You respond with Counterspell to stop the effect. The enemy casts their own Counterspell in response. Your Counterspell against the Fireball is nullified, and the Fireball goes off. 

These effects can become overwhelming with multiple responses being used simultaneously in the heat of combat. Be patient with yourself, your fellow players, and your Chaos Master when working through all of the effects and their respective position in order. 

##### Damage Types

Cards of Chaos uses various damage types to provide players with a greater array of spell options. Some damage types will prove effective or ineffective against different types of enemies. Work with your fellow players when building your deck to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. The damage types are: 

- Acid
- Bludgeoning
- Electric
- Fire
- Force
- Ice
- Necrotic
- Piercing
- Poison
- Psychic
- Radiant
- Slashing
- Sound
- Wind

##### Status Conditions

Status conditions will arise most often during conflict; physical or social. Certain cards will have tags to label what status condition they inflict. Most often, they are linked to a damage type. All status conditions end at the end of the target's next turn unless otherwise stated. The status condiitons in Cards of Chaos are:

**Drained:** Effected creature's maximum Chaos Energy is reduced by one until the end of their next turn.

### Rests

During the course of a game of Cards of Chaos, your CM may allow for a short or long rest. These rests are meant for your character to recuperate after any of the many trials and tribulations they are sure to take on. The two types of rests allow for varying degrees of recuperation, as described below: 

**Short Rests**
On a short rest, your character takes thirty minutes to one hour to rest and relax. This time may be spent refining their skills, reading a book, napping, eating, lightly socializing, getting familiar with a new tool or weapon, or the like. During this time, you may access your character's sideboard and or regenerate HP. The amount of cards in your sideboard is determined by the following formula: Proficiency Bonus + Prowess Modifier (or Chaos). Any cards in your deck may be exchanged for any other card in your sideboard. You may also heal your character a certain amount from the following formula: Proficiency Bonus x Tenacity Modifier. Treat any modifier less than one as a one. 
If your short rest is interrupted, you may attempt to restart. 
Your characters may rest as much or as little as they are able, but they will only gain the benefits of a short rest once every long rest. 

**Long Rests** 
Long rests are between 6 and 8 hours. Six of those hours must be spent sleeping, the reamining two may be spent continuing to sleep, or doing any activity that would qualify as a short rest. While your character sleeps, you may exchange any number of cards in your deck and sideboard for any other card. Any exiled card from your deck returns as well. You also heal in the night, and your HP returns to its maximum if you complete the entire rest. 
Any interrupted rest for longer than 30 minutes will result in needing to restart the long rest clock for your character. 
You may only gain the benefits of a long rest once every dawn.

As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring. 

# Building your Deck

When you build your first deck in Cards of Chaos, you'll first have to decide what type of character you want to be. Are you interested in playing an explosive Berserker, smashing those who stand in your way? Maybe you'd rather rely on stealth and cunning, waiting for the perfect moment to strike true and deliver one deadly blow. Whatever style of play you choose, this will be the backdrop for your personalized deck. 

As your character grows and develops, they will naturally gain more power and harness more Chaos Energy, allowing for more explosive, dynamic, and interesting spells. The following table describes at what level your character will gain access to more cards and more Chaos Energy.

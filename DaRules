### The Game

Cards of Chaos utilizes the Game Master and Player structure. Your Game Master, or Chaos Master (CM), is the governing body of the game at your table. They are responsible for running the game. The Players are what make the game come to life with interesting characters and a passion for story. The players and the CM work together in tandem to tell compelling stories. 
Cards of Chaos was created out of a joint passion of the designers for deck builder card games and table top role playing games. We hope that traditional TTRPG players and deck builders find Cards of Chaos the perfect blend of these game types. As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring. 

### Creating Your Character

When creating your character, there will be two distinct factors to guide your decision making process: The Class, and the Attributes. At Levels 3 and 7 you will gain an additional two Attribute Points to distribute among the four possible Attributes. 

#### Attributes

In Cards of Chaos, characters have four main Attributes that define their skills and abilities. Each Attribute starts with 5 points, equal to a modifier of 0. Each point over 5 is plus 1 to the Attribute's modifier. Each point under 5 is minus 1 to the Attribute's modifier. The maximum amount of points for an Attribute is 10 (a +5 modifier), with a minimum of 0 (a -5 modifier). The four Attributes are: 

##### Chaos 
Your Chaos Attribute relates to how much control you have over Chaos Magic. You will use your Chaos Modifier for checks and saves relating to magic. When attempting to resist an effect caused my magic, you will roll your D20 and add your Chaos Modifier. 
Your Spell Save DC is equal to 8 + Chaos Modifier + Level.  

##### Power
Your Power Attribute relates to how much control you have over your physical form. You will use your Power Modifier for checks and saves relating to the kinesthetic. This includes Weapon Attacks, grappling, and others. 
Your Power Save DC is equal to 8 + Power Modifier + Level

##### Personality
Your Personality Attribute relates to how much control you have over social encounters. You will use your Personality Modifier for social checks and saves.

Your base amount of HP will be determined by your class, with HP being added or subtracted by your Health Modifier. The Health Attribute will also be used for medicine, exhaustion, and overall vitality checks and saves. 
Your Health Save DC is equal to 8 + Health Modifier + Level.

### Building your Deck

When you build your first deck in Cards of Chaos, you'll first have to decide what type of character you want to be. Are you interested in playing an explosive Berserker, smashing those who stand in your way? Maybe you'd rather rely on stealth and cunning, waiting for the perfect moment to strike true and deliver one deadly blow as the Rogue. Whatever style of play you choose, this will be the backdrop for your personalized deck. 

As your character grows and develops, they will naturally gain more power and harness more Chaos Energy, allowing for more explosive, dynamic, and interesting spells. The following table describes at what level your character will gain access to more cards and more Chaos Energy.

### Combat

Chaos is the name of the game, and what's Chaos without Combat? At the beginning of combat, each combatant will roll their D20 and add their Power Attribute Modifier. The combatant with the highest number goes first, and so on. 
After turn order is determined, each player will take their respective turn.

#### Taking a Turn

On each of your turns, you will start with your maximum amount of Chaos Energy at your disposal. At the start of your turn, you will draw one card. Then, you may do the following in any order. 
- Move
- Cast Action
- Kinesthetic Action
	- Dash
	- Hide
	- Weapon Attack
	- Dodge
	- Use Object
	- Climb
	- Grapple
	- Tackle
	- Talk
- Ability Action
- Free Action

###### Move

On each of your turns, you may move up to your listed movement speed. This movement does not need to happen all at once. For example, a player may move 3 spaces to get within melee range of an enemy, and then move an additional 3 spaces away from that enemy. Your movement may be increased or decreased depending on the situation, so be sure to keep note of any spells or conditions affecting you during a game. 

##### Act

	Choosing to act during a climactic scene where time is of the essence can be stressful. You'll have multiple choices to make with cards you may or may not have been expecting to draw, allies in need, enemies attacking, another player giving you additional information, and maybe you need to go to the bathroom. The last thing you or your table need is someone barking orders at you or making you feel rushed. 
	When players are just beginning to learn the ins and outs of the game, they won't be familiar with their characters or their decks. Be patient with players when they are first starting, and offer help when asked. And if you are a new player learning everything all at once, just remember there are no wrong choices. Follow your gut and do what's fun. 

###### Cast Action

The leading form of harnessing Chaos Energy, spellcasting. Casting spells will most often be what you spend your turns doing in a game of Cards of Chaos. During your turn, you will have the ability to cast any number of spells in your hand with your alloted Chaos Energy unless otherwise specified. Spells may be cast in or outside of combat, and some will have varying effects based on the situation they are cast in. Other spells contain tags to indicate additional effects or stipulations. Read your spell cards closely to avoid misplays and maximize value.

###### Kinesthetic Actions

You may choose to take one Kinesthetic Action before or after your Cast Action. Your CM may require a Power Check for the Hide, Melee, Use Object, Climb, Grapple, and Tackle Actions, or a Personality Check for the Talk Action. 
	- Dash: For one Chaos Energy, double your movement. 
	- Hide: For two Chaos Energy, you may attempt to hide from detection. An enemy may attempt to find you with a Power Check against your Power Save DC. 
	- Weapon Attack: For one Chaos Energy, attack from a specified weapon range. Weapon Attack deals damage equal to Power Modifier * 3, unless otherwise specified by the weapon. An unarmed attack deals damage equal to your Power Modifier unless otherwise specified. 
	- Dodge: For three Chaos Energy, until your next turn, reduce the amount of damage taken by spell attacks and effects by Power Modifier * 3, and gain advantage on all Saves, unless otherwise specified. 
	- Use Object: Work with your CM to determine if the object you are trying to use would take a longer amount of time than 1 round, and what check (if any) is needed. 
	- Climb: For one Chaos Energy, your climbing speed is equal to half your total speed, and your CM may call for a Power Check. 
	- Grapple: For two mana, you may attempt to grapple another creature. The target makes a Power Save against your Power Save DC. On a failure, you have the opposing creature grappled. 
	- Tackle: For one Chaos Energy, you may attempt to tackle another creature. The target must make a Power Save against your power save DC. On a failure, the opposing creature is knocked prone. 
	- Talk: The talk action will normally require a Personality Check against the target's Personality Save DC. Typically it is used to deescalate a situation, distract, or gain information during combat. 

##### Ability Action
Abilities are specified by character class during the character creation process. The Ability Point cost associated with each class' specific abilities are described during the character creation process. Your number of ability points are equal to 2 * Power Modifier, with a minimum of 2. 

##### Free Action
A Free Action consists of any small action that likely will not have any associated checks. Some examples may include a shout or a wave. Work with your CM to determine what a Free Action might consist of for your table. 

##### Responses
At the end of your turn, if you have any unused Chaos Energy, it will remain until the beginning of your next turn. Some spells have the "Response" tag. These spells may only be cast in response to a trigger. These triggers may be specific and described on the spell card, or more general to be worked out between you and your Chaos Master. 
Responses follow the last in, first out rule. This means the last card played will be the first effect that happens in a series. For example: 
	An enemy attacks you for 10 fire damage. You respond by casting Elemental Resistance. The Elemental Resistance spell happens first, followed by the attack. You would take 5 fire damage. 
	An enemy Chaos Caster attacks you with a fireball. You respond with Counterspell to stop the effect. The enemy casts their own Counterspell in response. Your Counterspell against the Fireball is nullified, and the Fireball goes off. 

These effects can become overwhelming with multiple responses being used simultaneously in the heat of combat. Be patient with yourself, your fellow players, and your Chaos Master when working through all of the effects and their respective position in order.

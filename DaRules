### The Game

Cards of Chaos utilizes the Game Master and Player structure. Your Game Master, or Chaos Master (CM), is the governing body of the game at your table. They are responsible for running the game. The Players are what make the game come to life with interesting characters and a passion for story. The players and the CM work together in tandem to tell compelling stories. 
Cards of Chaos was created out of a joint passion of the designers for deck builder card games and table top role playing games. We hope that traditional TTRPG players and deck builders find Cards of Chaos the perfect blend of these game types. As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring. 

### Creating Your Character

The first step in character creation is developing a background for your character to fit them into the game world they'll be inhabiting. Choose a race or species (such as Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Orc, Animal Folk etc.) for your character that fits in the world your CM has created. Your choice will not have a mechanic impact on the game, but may help you determine how the character is played or interacts with the world. Your background can include the profession of your character and/or reasoning for seeking adventure. Use your character background information to guide your choices when developing your character. 

Characters beginning their journey at level 1 will generally be unskilled with little adventuring experience. Keep this in mind when creating your early level characters and speak with your CM if there are certain experiences you feel your character should possess. Overall, have fun and be creative when making your background. This is your opportunity to create a character that matches your playstyle and will shape how your character interacts with the world created by your CM.

When creating your character, there will be three distinct factors to guide your decision making process: The Class, Attributes, and Features.  

#### Features

Character features will help the player differentiate their character from the other player characters. Since picking a race in this game does not grant any mechanical advantages, the player can instead choose which features their character has from the start. Players receive 5 Character Points at the beginning of character creation used to buy Features from the Character Feature Page. Players can choose any combination of features, but the total Character Points of these features cannot exceed 5, and no Feature can be purchased twice. Character Features grant you the opportunity to make your character unique. You can choose a combination that feels powerful or a combination that is thematic with your background. For example, a background of a scholarly elf could lead to a player choosing darkvision and a skill proficiency in knowledge. Keep in mind, once you solidify your character features with your CM they cannot be changed unless specified by the CM.

**Character Point Cost - 1**

*Speedy:* You gain an additional 1 space to your walking speed.
*Darkvision:* You have the ability to see in dark and dim light up to 30 feet as though it were normal light.
*Claws:* You have sharp claws. Unarmed attacks deal an additional 2 damage.

At level 3, you are able to expend one second level spell from your spell list without expending the card. Once you cast a spell this way, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.
*Luck:* When you roll a 1 on a D20 roll, you may reroll the die. You must use the new roll.

#### Attributes

In Cards of Chaos, characters have four main Attributes that define their skills and abilities. Each Attribute starts with 5 points, equal to a modifier of 0. Each point over 5 is plus 1 to the Attribute's modifier. Each point under 5 is minus 1 to the Attribute's modifier. The maximum amount of points for an Attribute is 10 (a +5 modifier), with a minimum of 0 (a -5 modifier). At Levels 4, 8, 12, and 15 you will gain an additional two Attribute Points to distribute among the four possible Attributes. At level 1, you get 2 ability points to put into any of the four Attributes. If you choose, you can also reduce one Attribute from the base 5 to 4 at level 1, and gain an additional Attribute Point to distribute to a thrid Attribute. No single Attribute can be at a score of 8 at level 1. The four Attributes are:

#### Class

### Building your Deck

When you build your first deck in Cards of Chaos, you'll first have to decide what type of character you want to be. Are you interested in playing an explosive Berserker, smashing those who stand in your way? Maybe you'd rather rely on stealth and cunning, waiting for the perfect moment to strike true and deliver one deadly blow as the Rogue. Whatever style of play you choose, this will be the backdrop for your personalized deck. 

As your character grows and develops, they will naturally gain more power and harness more Chaos Energy, allowing for more explosive, dynamic, and interesting spells. The following table describes at what level your character will gain access to more cards and more Chaos Energy.

### Combat

Chaos is the name of the game, and what's Chaos without Combat? At the beginning of combat, each combatant will roll their D20 and add their Power Attribute Modifier. The combatant with the highest number goes first, and so on. 
After turn order is determined, each player will take their respective turn.

#### Taking a Turn

On each of your turns, you will start with your maximum amount of Chaos Energy at your disposal. At the start of your turn, you will draw one card. Then, you may do the following in any order. 
- Move
- Cast Action
- Kinesthetic Action
	- Dash
	- Hide
	- Weapon Attack
	- Dodge
	- Use Object
	- Climb
	- Grapple
	- Tackle
	- Talk
- Ability Action
- Free Action

###### Move

On each of your turns, you may move up to your listed movement speed. This movement does not need to happen all at once. For example, a player may move 3 spaces to get within melee range of an enemy, and then move an additional 3 spaces away from that enemy. Your movement may be increased or decreased depending on the situation, so be sure to keep note of any spells or conditions affecting you during a game. 

##### Act

	Choosing to act during a climactic scene where time is of the essence can be stressful. You'll have multiple choices to make with cards you may or may not have been expecting to draw, allies in need, enemies attacking, another player giving you additional information, and maybe you need to go to the bathroom. The last thing you or your table need is someone barking orders at you or making you feel rushed. 
	When players are just beginning to learn the ins and outs of the game, they won't be familiar with their characters or their decks. Be patient with players when they are first starting, and offer help when asked. And if you are a new player learning everything all at once, just remember there are no wrong choices. Follow your gut and do what's fun. 

###### Cast Action

The leading form of harnessing Chaos Energy, spellcasting. Casting spells will most often be what you spend your turns doing in a game of Cards of Chaos. During your turn, you will have the ability to cast any number of spells in your hand with your alloted Chaos Energy unless otherwise specified. Spells may be cast in or outside of combat, and some will have varying effects based on the situation they are cast in. Other spells contain tags to indicate additional effects or stipulations. Read your spell cards closely to avoid misplays and maximize value.

###### Kinesthetic Actions

You may choose to take one Kinesthetic Action before or after your Cast Action. Your CM may require a Power Check for the Hide, Melee, Use Object, Climb, Grapple, and Tackle Actions, or a Prowess Check for the Talk Action. 
	- Dash: For one Chaos Energy, double your movement. 
	- Hide: For two Chaos Energy, you may attempt to hide from detection. An enemy may attempt to find you with a Power Check against your Power Save DC. 
	- Weapon Attack: For one Chaos Energy, attack from a specified weapon range. Weapon Attack deals damage equal to Power Modifier * 3, unless otherwise specified by the weapon. An unarmed attack deals damage equal to your Power Modifier unless otherwise specified. 
	- Dodge: For three Chaos Energy, until your next turn, reduce the amount of damage taken by spell attacks and effects by Power Modifier * 3, and gain advantage on all Saves, unless otherwise specified. 
	- Use Object: Work with your CM to determine if the object you are trying to use would take a longer amount of time than 1 round, and what check (if any) is needed. 
	- Climb: For one Chaos Energy, your climbing speed is equal to half your walking speed, unless you have the *Climber* Feature. Your CM may call for a Power Check. 
	- Grapple: For two mana, you may attempt to grapple another creature. The target makes a Power Save against your Power Save DC. On a failure, you have the opposing creature grappled. 
	- Tackle: For one Chaos Energy, you may attempt to tackle another creature. The target must make a Power Save against your power save DC. On a failure, the opposing creature is knocked prone. 
	- Talk: The talk action will normally require a Prowess Check against the target's Save DC. Typically it is used to deescalate a situation, distract, or gain information during combat. 

##### Ability Action
Abilities are specified by character class during the character creation process. The Ability Point cost associated with each class' specific abilities are described during the character creation process. Your number of ability points are equal to 2 * Power Modifier, with a minimum of 2. 

##### Free Action
A Free Action consists of any small action that likely will not have any associated checks. Some examples may include a shout or a wave. Work with your CM to determine what a Free Action might consist of for your table. 

##### Responses
At the end of your turn, if you have any unused Chaos Energy, it will remain until the beginning of your next turn. Some spells have the "Response" tag. These spells may only be cast in response to a trigger. These triggers may be specific and described on the spell card, or more general to be worked out between you and your Chaos Master. 
Responses follow the last in, first out rule. This means the last card played will be the first effect that happens in a series. For example: 
	An enemy attacks you for 10 fire damage. You respond by casting Elemental Resistance. The Elemental Resistance spell happens first, followed by the attack. You would take 5 fire damage. 
	An enemy Chaos Caster attacks you with a fireball. You respond with Counterspell to stop the effect. The enemy casts their own Counterspell in response. Your Counterspell against the Fireball is nullified, and the Fireball goes off. 

These effects can become overwhelming with multiple responses being used simultaneously in the heat of combat. Be patient with yourself, your fellow players, and your Chaos Master when working through all of the effects and their respective position in order.

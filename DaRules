### The Game

Cards of Chaos was created out of a joint passion of the designers for deck builder card games and table top role playing games. We hope that traditional TTRPG players and deck builders find Cards of Chaos the perfect blend of these game types. As a player of CoC you can not only personalize your character, but the spells at your disposal session after session. Strategy meets role play in this table top game where you never know what your next hand will bring. 

### Building your Deck

When you build your first deck in Cards of Chaos, you'll first have to decide what type of character you want to be. Are you interested in playing an explosive Berserker, smashing those who stand in your way? Maybe you'd rather rely on stealth and cunning, waiting for the perfect moment to strike true and deliver one deadly blow. Whatever style of play you choose, this will be the backdrop for your personalized deck. 

As your character grows and develops, they will naturally gain more power and harness more Chaos Energy, allowing for more explosive, dynamic, and interesting spells. The following table describes at what level your character will gain access to more cards and more Chaos Energy.

### Combat

### Taking a Turn

On each of your turns, you will start with your maximum amount of Chaos Energy at your disposal. At the start of your turn, you will draw one card. Then, you may do any number of the following actions in any order. 
- Move
- Cast Spells
- Use an Ability 
At the end of your turn, if you have any unused Chaos Energy, it will remain until the beginning of your next turn. Some spells have the "Response" tag. These spells may only be cast in response to a trigger. These triggers may be specific and described on the spell card, or more general to be worked out between you and your Chaos Master.
